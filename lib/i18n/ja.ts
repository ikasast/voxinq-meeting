// English to Japanese.

// The key is the English sentence the component contains, so this file reads as a table rather
// than as a set of names — somebody can check a translation here without knowing where it
// appears. Rows are grouped by screen, in the order the screens were translated.
//
// **Every row is written, not generated.** Machine translation is close enough to look finished
// and wrong in the places that matter: 「録音」and「収録」are both "record", and only one of them
// is what a person does to a meeting. Where the English is deliberately plain, the Japanese is
// too.
//
// A missing row shows the English, which is legible. `tests/i18n.test.ts` fails on one anyway,
// and on a row left here after its sentence was rewritten.
